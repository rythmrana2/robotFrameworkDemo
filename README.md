robot frameowrk demo 
Through this project i am doing poc to use this technology at my organization.
this project is not about the proper project structure or using the best xpath or css but about looking at the benefit of using this technology for automation according to the needs of the org.

1. after pulling the branch do pip install -r requirements.txt to get all dependencies.
2. use data.yaml file to store passwords and important organization information.
3. use the chromedriver version suitable for your chrome version
4. run command robot -d log testcasename.robot to store output fiels in log directory
5. use page object model to structure and create files and keywords.
